# Medilink 🏥

Medilink is a personal front-end project created to explore modern UI design, layout structuring, and theme management using **pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. The goal of this project is to build a clean, functional, and visually balanced header interface similar to what you would find in real-world healthcare or productivity dashboards.

This project is not tied to any academic requirement or internship task. It was built purely for learning, experimentation, and personal growth in front-end development.

## 🧠 Why Medilink?

While learning front-end development, I wanted to focus on **practical UI problems** such as:
- Proper alignment of icons and elements
- Creating a usable and clean header layout
- Implementing a light/dark theme toggle
- Writing maintainable and readable CSS
- Understanding how small UI details impact user experience

Medilink was built as a sandbox to practice these concepts without using any frameworks.

## ✨ What This Project Does

Medilink currently focuses on the **header section** of a healthcare dashboard and includes:

- A **brand logo section** with a circular logo
- A **search bar** positioned near action icons for accessibility
- A **dark / light mode toggle** with dynamic icon switching
- **Notification and profile icons** with perfectly centered content
- Smooth transitions between themes
- A minimal and modern visual style

All layout alignment is handled using **Flexbox**, ensuring consistency and responsiveness.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – Markup and structure
- **CSS3** – Layout, styling, themes, transitions
- **JavaScript** – Theme toggle logic and DOM manipulation

No external libraries or frameworks are used.

## ⚙️ How It Works

- Clicking the theme button toggles a `.dark` class on the `<body>` element.
- CSS applies different color schemes based on the presence of this class.
- The theme button icon updates dynamically to reflect the active mode.
- Icons and buttons use Flexbox to keep emojis centered inside circular containers.

## 🔮 Future Ideas

This project is intentionally open-ended. Possible future additions include:

- Full dashboard layout
- Patient and appointment sections
- Persistent theme using `localStorage`
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Replacing emojis with SVG icons
- Accessibility improvements (ARIA roles, contrast tuning)
