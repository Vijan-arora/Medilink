# Medilink 🏥

Medilink is a personal front-end project created to explore UI design, layout structure, and interactive functionality using **pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. The purpose of this project is to build a clean and modern header interface similar to what you would find in real-world dashboard applications, while practicing core front-end skills.

This is a **personal project**—not tied to academics or internships—and was built to improve design sensibilities, experiment with theme toggling, and understand layout alignment challenges.

---

## 🌟 Project Overview

The current focus of Medilink is on rendering a professional, responsive header that includes:

- A modern **logo section**
- A usable **search bar**
- A **dark/light theme toggle**
- A **notification icon**
- A **user profile icon**

All header elements are aligned using **Flexbox** for consistency and responsiveness. Special attention has been given to the visual alignment of icons and theme elements for a balanced UI experience.

## 🚀 Key Features

- 🌓 **Dark/Light Mode Toggle**  
  Switch between dark and light themes with a single click. The theme state instantly updates the UI colors and toggle icon.

- 🔍 **Search Bar**  
  A clean search input placed near functional icons for better accessibility and design balance.

- 🔔 **Notification Icon**  
  A circular notification element with centered emoji design that can be extended into real notifications later.

- 👤 **Profile Icon**  
  A simple profile icon placeholder for future improvement.

- 🎨 **Visual Consistency**  
  Smooth transitions, centered icons, consistent spacing, minimalistic color scheme.

## ⚙ How Theme Toggling Works

- Clicking the theme button toggles a `.dark` class on `<body>`
- CSS uses this class to switch color schemes
- The toggle icon updates dynamically based on theme mode

---

## 🔮 Future Possibilities

This project is still evolving. Some future enhancements could include:

- Making the layout **mobile responsive**
- Adding a **persistent theme** using `localStorage`
- Integrating other dashboard sections like patient lists and schedules
- Replacing emoji icons with custom SVG graphics
- Adding **animations and accessibility improvements**
